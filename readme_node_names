Information on the BASH Script to convert callsigns to .gsm audio files
so your your node speaks the callsign of the node you are connecting to
instead of just the node number.

This is how I installed the script.

Downloaded the script    write_node_callsigns.tar.gz  onto my Windows PC.

Using WinSCP I made a new directory called scripts in  /etc/asterisk
then I opened     /etc/asterisk/scripts

Move the zipped file into that directory
Now using Putty I switched to that directory

cd /etc/asterisk/scripts

unzip the file

Run the script by typing      
./write_node_callsigns

You should now see a whole bunch of text flying my on the screen as 
it is now converting all the callsigns in /var/log/asterisk/astdb.txt
into .gsm audio files.

the .gsm files will be be stored in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/rpt/nodemames
